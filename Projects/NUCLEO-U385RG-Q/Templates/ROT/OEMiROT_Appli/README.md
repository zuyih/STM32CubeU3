## <b>OEMiROT_Appli Template Description</b>

This project provides a OEMiROT boot path Full Secure reference template. Boot is performed through OEMiROT boot path after authenticity and the integrity checks of the project firmware and data
images.

Please remember that on system with security enabled, the system always boots in secure. When the secure application is started the MPU
is already configured (by OEMiROT) to limit the execution area to the project firmware execution slot. This is done in order to avoid
any malicious code execution from an unauthorised area (RAM, out of execution slot in user flash ...). Once started, it is up to the secure
application to adapt the security configuration to its needs. In this template, the MPU is simply disabled.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This template runs on STM32U385xx devices with security enabled (TZEN=B4).
  - This template has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-U385RG-Q (MB1841)

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

<u>Before compiling the project, you should first start the provisioning process</u>. During the provisioning process, the linker files
will be automatically updated.

Before starting the provisioning process, select the application project to use (application example or template),
through oemirot_appli_path_project variable in ROT_Provisioning/env.bat or env.sh.
Then start provisioning process by running provisioning.bat (.sh) from ROT_Provisioning/OEMiROT or ROT_Provisioning/OEMiROT_OEMuROT,
and follow its instructions. Refer to ROT_Provisioning/OEMiROT or ROT_Provisioning/OEMiROT_OEMuROT readme for more information on
the provisioning process for OEMiROT boot path or OEMiROT_OEMuROT boot path.

After application startup, check if the LED is blinking.

For more details, refer to STM32U3 Wiki articles:

  - [STM32U3 security](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Category:STM32U3).
  - [OEMiRoT OEMuRoT for STM32U3](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Security:OEMiRoT_OEMuRoT_for_STM32U3).

#### <b>Note:</b>

  1. The most efficient way to develop and debug an application is to boot directly on user flash in RDL level 0 by setting with
     STM32CubeProgrammer the RDP to 0xAA and the SECBOOTADD to (0x0C006000 + offset of the firmware execution slot).

  2. Two versions of ROT_AppliConfig are available: windows executable and python version. By default, the windows executable is selected. It
     is possible to switch to python version by:
        - installing python (Python 3.10 or newer) with the required modules listed in requirements.txt.
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        - having python in execution path variable
        - deleting main.exe in Utilities\PC_Software\ROT_AppliConfig\dist
