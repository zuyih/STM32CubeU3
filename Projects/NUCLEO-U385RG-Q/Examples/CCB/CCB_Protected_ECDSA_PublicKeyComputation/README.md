## <b>CCB_Protected_ECDSA_PublicKeyComputation Example Description</b>

How to use the CCB peripheral to compute public Key, using a special blob called "ECDSA key blob". 
ECDSA is Elliptic Durve Digital Signature Algorithm.

At the beginning of the main program, the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK).

The CCB peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_CCB_Init() function.
This function calls the HAL_CCB_MspInit() function, which implements the configuration
of the necessary CCB resources according to the hardware used (PKA, RNG and SAES) and enables the clock.

This example uses the Derived Hardware Unique Key (DHUK) as wrapping key.
The selected curve for this example is P-256 (ECDSA-256) published by NIST in
Federal Information Processing Standards Publication FIPS PUB 186-4.
The related information is included in the ECDSAparam structure.
ECDSAKeyBlob will contain pointers to the reserved output buffers of IV, Tag, and the wrapped Private Key.
Calling HAL_CCB_ECDSA_WrapPrivateKey will wrap the user private key according to the ECDSA parameters.

STM32 board LED is used to monitor the example status:

  - LD2 is ON when the public Key is computed.
  - LD2 is slowly blinking when there is an error.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1.  Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
     based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
     a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
     than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
     To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2.  The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
     to have correct HAL operation.
