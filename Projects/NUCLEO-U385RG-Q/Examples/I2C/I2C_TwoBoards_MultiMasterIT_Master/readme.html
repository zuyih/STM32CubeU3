<h2 id="i2c_twoboards_multimasterit_master-example-description"><b>I2C_TwoBoards_MultiMasterIT_Master Example Description</b></h2>
<p>How to handle an I2C as a Master to perform a data buffer communication between two boards, using an interrupt and two Masters and one Slave.</p>
<pre><code>  - Board: NUCLEO-U385RG-Q&#39;s (embeds a STM32U385RG device)
  - SCL Master1 Pin: PB10 (Arduino D6 CN9 pin 7, Morpho CN10 pin 25)
  - SDA Master1 Pin: PA6 (Arduino D12 CN5 pin 5, Morpho CN10 pin 13)
  - SCL Master2 Pin: PC0 (Arduino SCL/A5 CN6 pin 6, Morpho CN7 pin 38)
  - SDA Master2 Pin: PC1 (Arduino SDA/A4 CN6 pin 5, Morpho CN7 pin 36)
  - SCL Slave   Pin: PB10 (Arduino D6 CN9 pin 7, Morpho CN10 pin 25)
  - SDA Slave   Pin: PA6 (Arduino D12 CN5 pin 5, Morpho CN10 pin 13)
  Connect GND between each board.</code></pre>
<p>At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick. Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 96 MHz.</p>
<p>The I2C peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_I2C_Init() function. This later is calling the HAL_I2C_MspInit() function which core is implementing the configuration of the needed I2C resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, GPIO and NVIC). You may update this function to change I2C configuration.</p>
<p>The TIM peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_TIM_Init() function. This later is calling the HAL_TIM_MspInit() function which core is implementing the configuration of the needed TIM resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, GPIO and NVIC). You may update this function to change TIM configuration.</p>
<p>The TIM peripheral is used to simulate a RTOS scheduling, between Master1 manage through main() function and Master 2 through HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback(). Every millisecond, the timer will send an interrupt to give the Master2 the upperhand for the communication with the Slave.</p>
<p>For this example the aTxBufferMaster1 and aTxBufferMaster2 are predefined with different text value which can easily identified through the Terminal IO of the Slave.</p>
<p>In a first step after initialization of I2C Master1, Master2 and Timer.</p>
<p>Each time the timer generate an interrupt, the associated callback HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback() is called and a Master2 starts the communication by sending aTxBufferMaster2 through HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit_IT() to I2C Slave which receives aRxBuffer through HAL_I2C_Slave_Receive_IT().</p>
<p>Then when user press the User push-button on the Master Board, I2C Master1 starts the communication by sending aTxBufferMaster1 through HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit_IT() to I2C Slave which receives aRxBuffer through HAL_I2C_Slave_Receive_IT().</p>
<p>Each time the slave retrieve a buffer, associated variable are incremented. User can easily add to live watch the variable nbMst1RxCplt and nbMst2RxCplt to catch the Multimaster buffer reception on Slave side.</p>
<p>And user can easily add to live watch the variable Master1BusBusyCpt and Master2BusBusyCpt to catch the Multimaster bandwidth detection on Master side.</p>
<p>NUCLEO-U385RG-Q's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status: LD2 toggle each time the timer period elapsed. LD2 is slowly blinking (1 sec. period) in case of error in initialization or transmission process.</p>
<h4 id="notes"><b>Notes</b></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.</p></li>
<li><p>The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.</p></li>
