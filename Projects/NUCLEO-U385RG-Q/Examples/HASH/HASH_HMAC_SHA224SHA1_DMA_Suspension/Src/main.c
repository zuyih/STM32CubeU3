/*
  "The hash processor is a fully compliant implementation of the secure hash algorithm
(SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256), the MD5 (message-digest algorithm 5) hash algorithm and
the HMAC (keyed-hash message authentication code) algorithm suitable for a variety of
applications. It computes a message digest (160 bits for the SHA-1 algorithm, 256 bits for
the SHA-256 algorithm and 224 bits for the SHA-224 algorithm,128 bits for the MD5
algorithm) for messages of up to (264 - 1) bits, while HMAC algorithm provide a way of
authenticating messages by means of hash functions. HMAC algorithm consist in calling
the SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256 or MD5 hash function twice.

The FIPS PUB 180-2 standard and the IETF RFC 1321 publication specify the SHA-1, SHA-
224 and SHA-256 and MD5 secure hash algorithms, respectively, for computing a
condensed representation of a message or data file. When a message of any length below
264 bits is provided on input, the SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256 and MD5 produce
respective a 160-bit, 224 bit, 256 bit and 128-bit output string, respectively, called a
message digest. The message digest can then be processed with a digital signature
algorithm in order to generate or verify the signature for the message. Signing the message
digest rather than the message often improves the efficiency of the process because the
message digest is usually much smaller in size than the message. The verifier of a digital
signature has to use the same hash algorithm as the one used by the creator of the digital
signature.
The SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256 and MD5 are qualified as "secure" because it is
computationally infeasible to find a message that corresponds to a given message digest, or
to find two different messages that produce the same message digest. Any change to a
message in transit will, with very high probability, result in a different message digest, and
the signature will fail to verify. For more detail on the SHA-1 or SHA-224 and SHA-256
algorithm, please refer to the FIPS PUB 180-2 (Federal Information Processing Standards
Publication 180-2), 2002 august 1.

The current implementation of this standard works with little-endian input data convention.
For example, the C string "abc" must be represented in memory as the 24-bit hexadecimal
value 0x434241.
A message or data file to be processed by the hash processor should be considered a bit
string. The length of the message is the number of bits in the message (the empty message
has length 0). You can consider that 32 bits of this bit string forms a 32-bit word. Note that
the FIPS PUB 180-1 standard uses the convention that bit strings grow from left to right, and
bits can be grouped as bytes (8 bits) or words (32 bits) (but some implementations also use
half-words (16 bits), and implicitly, uses the big-endian byte (half-word) ordering. This
convention is mainly important for padding.

Data are entered into the hash processor 32 bits (word) at a time, by writing them into the
HASH_DIN register. But the original bit-string can be organized in bytes, half-words or
words, or even be represented as bits. As the system memory organization is little-endian
and SHA1, SHA-224 and SHA-256 computation is big-endian, depending on the way the
original bit string is grouped, a bit, byte, or half-word swapping operation is performed
automatically by the hash processor.
The kind of data to be processed is configured with the DATATYPE bitfield in the HASH
control register (HASH_CR)."
