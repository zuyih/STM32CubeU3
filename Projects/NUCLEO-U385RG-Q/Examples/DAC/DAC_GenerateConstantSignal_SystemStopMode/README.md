## <b>DAC_GenerateConstantSignal_SystemStopMode Example Description</b>

How to use the DAC peripheral to do a simple conversion with the MCU in STOP mode.
This example is based on the STM32U3xx DAC HAL API.

Example configuration:
The example uses the DAC for a simple conversion in 8 bits right
alignment of 0xFF value, the result of conversion can be seen by
connecting PA4(A2 Arduino CN8 pin 3, Morpho CN7 pin32) to an oscilloscope.

Example execution:
From the main program execution, DAC  is enabled and do a constant voltage.
- After 5 seconds, the MCU enter in STOP mode.
- The observed value remains at 3.3V
- Press user button to generate an interrupt and exit STOP mode.
- Repeat the example execution. 

LD2 is used to monitor program execution status:
- Normal operation:
  - LD2 turned on if the MCU is in Normal mode
  - LD2 turned off if the MCU is in STOP mode
- Error: LD2 remaining turned on

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
