## <b>ADF_AudioSoundDetector Example Description</b>

  This project demonstrates how to configure ADF to perform audio sound detection.

  One digital microphone of X-NUCLEO-CCA02M2 (digital mems microphone expansion board) is used on this example.
  X-NUCLEO-CCA02M2 is connected but not plugged on NUCLEO-U385RG-Q board.
  Following wired connections are needed:
  - CN7 pin 2 of NUCLEO-U385RG-Q (ADF1_SDIO) needs to be connected to CN10 pin 26 of X-NUCLEO-CCA02M2 (MIC_PDM12).
  - CN7 pin 1 of NUCLEO-U385RG-Q (ADF1_CCK1) needs to be connected to CN10 pin 29 of X-NUCLEO-CCA02M2 (MIC_CLK_NUCLEO).
  - CN6 pin 4 of NUCLEO-U385RG-Q (3V3) needs to be connected to CN6 pin 4 of X-NUCLEO-CCA02M2 (3V3).
  - CN6 pin 6 of NUCLEO-U385RG-Q (GND) needs to be connected to CN6 pin 6 of X-NUCLEO-CCA02M2 (GND).

  On this example, ADF1 kernel clock is set to MSIK and MSIK is configured at 48MHZ.
  ADF1 processing clock will be set to 24MHz and output clock frequency on ADF1_CCK1 will de set to 2MHz.
  With a filter decimation of 32 and a reshape filter decimation ratio of 4,
  we will obtain PCM samples at around 16KHz (2MHz/(32*4)).

  Sound Activity Detector (SAD) will be activated in voice activity detector mode.
  SAD will be configured with a frame size of 8 PCM samples, a minimum noise level of 200, hysteresis enable,
  a hangover window of 512 frames, 2 learning frames and a signal noise ratio of 6dB.
  Sound activity detection interrupt will be rising when SAD will enter in detect mode.
  Data memory transfer to record buffer will occur only when SAD will be on detect state, during this period green
  led toggles quickly.

  If error occurs during previous steps, green led toggles slowly.

  This project is targeted to run on STM32U385RG device on NUCLEO-U385RG-Q board from STMicroelectronics.

  The project configures the maximum system clock frequency at 96Mhz.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
 3. The instruction cache (ICACHE) must be enabled by software to get a 0 wait-state execution
    from Flash memory and external memories, and reach the maximum performance.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32U385RG devices without security enabled (TZEN=0).
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-U385RG-Q (MB1841)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.
