## <b>Initial_Attestation_KWE Application Description</b>

This application describes how to use the PSA Crypto opaque driver based on STM32
Key Wrape Engine to sign an entity attestation token (ETA) for initial attestation
using the device unique authentication key (DUA) in wrapped form.

This application is configured to use the Hardware library.

Two keys are supported, DUA_USER_FU for free usage and DUA_USER_LU for licensed usage.

Prerequisite:

 - Select which key to use DUA_USER_FU or DUA_USER_LU for the initial attestation.
 - Use STM32CubeProgrammer and the root security services (RSS) to export the
   device unique authentication key (DUA_FU or DUA_LU) in wrapped form.
 - Read protection (RDP) level and security level (secure, non secure) should be
   set up during the key export using STM32CubeProgrammer and the root security services (RSS).

This application is scheduled as follow:

  - Initialize the PSA Crypto Library.
  - Generate a challenge and fill the attestation token. The challenge could be replaced by one
    from the server.
  - Collect device information and fill the attestation token. The user should update information
    depending on their application.
  - Compute measurements by hashing the firmware data and fill the attestation token.
  - Compute the hash of the token, excluding the signature field.
  - Import the device user key (DUA_FU or DUA_LU) to sign the token. The DUA user key is already
    wrapped using the root security services (RSS).
  - Sign the token using the STM32 Key Wrap Engine and the device user key (DUA_FU or DUA_LU).
  - Optional: Export the public key from the device user key (DUA_FU or DUA_LU) to verify the
    token signature.
  - Optional: Import the public key and verify the token signature
  - Convert the public Key to PEM format.
  - Convert the entity attestation token (ETA) to PEM format.
  - Get DUA USER Certificate : DUA_USER_FU for free usage and DUA_USER_LU for licensed usage.
  - Optional: Compare the public key from the certificate with the exported public key from
    the wrapped key to avoid using DUA_USER_LU key with DUA_USER_FU certificate or DUA_USER_FU
    key with DUA_USER_LU certificate.
  - Convert the certificate to PEM format.
  - Destroy the keys to free up resources.

####  <b>Expected success behavior</b>

- The green led will be turned on
- The global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

- The green led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- The global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED
