## <b>RSA_PKCS1v1.5_Sign_KWE Application Description</b>

This application describes how to use the PSA Crypto opaque driver based on STM32
Key Wrape Engine to wrap the RSA private key and use the wrapped key to 
compute RSA PCKS1v1.5 signature.

This application is configured to use the Hardware library.

This application demonstrates how to use the library services to perform RSA operation
in a single call method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation
is done in one single API call.

This application is scheduled as follow:

  - Initialize the PSA Crypto Library.
  - Wrap the private key using key import operation and KWE driver location.
  - Sign the message using the wrapped private key, so that generated signature
    can be compared to the known signature
  - Verify the signature of the message using the regular public key, so that
    the generated signature can be compared to the known signature
  - Destroy keys to free up resources.

####  <b>Expected success behavior</b>

- The green led will be turned on
- The global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

- The green led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- The global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED
